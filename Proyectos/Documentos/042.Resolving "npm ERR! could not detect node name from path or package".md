The v15 version of Node has recently been released and is causing issues with some of our project code.

In the next lecture you may get the following error when building the Dockerfile:

npm ERR! could not detect node name from path or package

To resolve this, add a WORKDIR right after the FROM instruction: (we will be adding this very soon anyway)

    FROM node:alpine
     
    WORKDIR /usr/app
