Some students, depending on the release channel they are on, will now have "Buildkit" enabled by default. If so, you will notice a slightly different output in your terminal when building from a Dockerfile.

The main difference for students will be the final step in the build process. As shown in the lecture the last step would say:

    ---> fc60771eaa08
    Successfully Built fc60771eaa08
     

Now, with Buildkit, the final step would say:

     => => exporting layers                                                      
    0.0s => => writing image sha256:ee59c34ada9890ca09145cc88ccb25d32b677fc3b61e921  0.0s
     

Both fc60771eaa08 and ee59c34ada9890ca09145cc88ccb25d32b677fc3b61e921 are the resulting image ID's that you would use to run a container.

eg:

    docker run fc60771eaa08

or

    docker run ee59c34ada9890ca09145cc88ccb25d32b677fc3b61e921

If you wish to disable the Buildkit feature so that you can more accurately follow along with the course, do the following:

1.Click the Docker Icon your systray

2.Select "Preferences"

3.Select "Docker Engine"

4.Change buildkit from true to false

        {
          "features": {
            "buildkit": false
          },
          "experimental": false
        }

5.Apply and Restart.
