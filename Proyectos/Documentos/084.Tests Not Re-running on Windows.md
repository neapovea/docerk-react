If you are using Windows Home you may have noticed that when adding a test or making a change to the App.test.js the tests are not re-running inside the container.

While this works on macOS (and likely Linux), Jest watchers seem to be completely broken on certain versions of Windows. We are looking into a potential fix or hack to get this working again and will update this note if we find one.

Note - Since the latest release of Create React App and Docker Desktop v2.2 this does not appear to be an issue for Windows Pro or Enterprise users.
