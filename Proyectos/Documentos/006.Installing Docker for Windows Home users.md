If you are a Windows Home user, you will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

##Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead.

Docs and setup info available here:
https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

Release downloads available here:
https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases

Toolbox will install everything you need including VirtualBox.

You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings. This will be different for each manufacturer, please refer to their documentation on which keys to use to access these settings on reboot.

After Toolbox is finished installing, open the Docker Quickstart Terminal. This will complete the setup and provision your VirtualBox machine.

##Check your install:

Launch the Docker QuickStart terminal and type the command:

    docker run hello-world

This should pull down the test container and print hello-world to your screen.

##*Note*

A major difference between the course lecture using Docker Desktop vs. Docker Toolbox is that you will not be able to use localhost anymore. Instead, we will need to use the IP address returned by running docker-machine ip

Very commonly this is 192.168.99.100, but for you, it could be slightly different.
