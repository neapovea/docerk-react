These steps listed below are for Ubuntu Desktop LTS. You can find the full official docs and steps for other Linux distributions here:

Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
(Note: Students have encountered issues when using CentOS or RHEL as the host related to Docker container communication. You may need to research some workaround for the errors you run into or search the QA for already posted solutions)

Debian: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/

##Installation Steps

1.Create Dockerhub account

    https://hub.docker.com/signup

2.Install Docker

    The Docker docs suggest setting up a Docker repository to install and update from.
    This is where you should start: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository

3.Login to the Dockerhub

    In order to push and pull images, you will need to login to the Dockerhub. In your terminal, run docker login and then enter your Dockerhub account's username and password.

4.Test Docker installation

    After completing the installation steps, test out Docker by running sudo docker run hello-world. This should download and run the test container printing "hello world" to your console.

5.Installing Docker Compose

    Unlike the Mac and Windows Docker Desktop versions, we must manually install Docker Compose. See the instructions for the installation steps (Click on the tab for Linux)
    https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

6.Testing Docker Compose

    After completing, test your installation by running docker-compose -v. This should print the version and build numbers to your console.

7.Run without Sudo

    Follow these instructions to run Docker commands without sudo:
    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

8.Start on Boot

    Follow these instructions so that Docker and its services start automatically on boot:
    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot

You may need to restart your system before starting the course material.
