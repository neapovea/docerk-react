###updated 10-8-2020

On October 6, [AWS made some significant platform changes](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=8136) that will affect our single container application. Among these changes was adding the full support of using Docker Compose to provision a production AWS environment. This means that Elastic Beanstalk will no longer first look for a Dockerfile, it will first look for a docker-compose file and attempt to build and run a container from it.

When creating our Elastic Beanstalk environment in the next lecture, we need to select Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux instead of Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2. This will ensure that our container is built using the Dockerfile and not the compose file.
