In the upcoming lecture we will be adding our AWS variables to the deploy script of the .travis.yml file. There is a slight change that will be required, otherwise you will get an error when Travis attempts to run your code.

The code will now look like this:

    access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
