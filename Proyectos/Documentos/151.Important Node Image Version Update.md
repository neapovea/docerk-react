# Important Node Image Version Update
# 10-26-2020

In the next lecture, we will be creating a Dockerfile for the production server container. The Node v15 image was just released a few days ago and is breaking the code in our server/index.js.

To work around this, we need to change the version of Node this container will use:

`FROM node:alpine`

to this:

`FROM node:14.14.0-alpine`
