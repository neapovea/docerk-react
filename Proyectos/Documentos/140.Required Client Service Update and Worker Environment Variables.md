# Required Client Service Update and Worker Environment Variables

In the next lecture, we will be adding a client and worker service. There are two required configuration updates that need to be made:

1) When adding the "Client" service, be sure to include the stdin_open: true configuration:

>      client:
>        stdin_open: true
>        build:
>          dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
>          context: ./client
>        volumes:
>          - /app/node_modules
>          - ./client:/app

Otherwise, you will get a "React App exited with Code 0" error in your terminal when we attempt to start up the application.

2) When adding the "Worker" service, include the Redis host and port as environment variables:

>      worker:
>        build:
>          dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
>          context: ./worker
>        volumes:
>         - /app/node_modules
>          - ./worker:/app
>        environment:
>         - REDIS_HOST=redis
>          - REDIS_PORT=6379

Otherwise, you will get a "Calculated Nothing Yet" error message.
