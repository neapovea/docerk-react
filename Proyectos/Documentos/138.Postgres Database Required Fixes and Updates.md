# Postgres Database Required Fixes and Updates

## updated 6-12-2020

Due to a recent update in the official Postgres image hosted on the DockerHub we need to make a change to our environment variables.

Add the following to your docker-compose.yml file in the postgres service:

      postgres:
        image: "postgres:latest"
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password
     

`docker-compose down  && docker-compose up --build`

Please note, all of these changes are reflected in the downloadable checkpoint zip files.
