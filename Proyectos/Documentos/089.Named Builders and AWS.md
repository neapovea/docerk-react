## updated 10-1-2020

In the next lecture, we will be creating a multi-step build in our production Dockerfile. AWS currently will fail if you attempt to use a named builder as shown.

To remedy this, we should create an unnamed builder like so:

Instead of this:

    FROM node:alpine as builder
    WORKDIR '/app'
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build
     
    FROM nginx
    COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

Do this:

    FROM node:alpine
    WORKDIR '/app'
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build
     
    FROM nginx
    COPY --from=0 /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
