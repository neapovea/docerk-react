In the next lecture, Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. This method of generating a React project is no longer recommended.

Instead of this:

`npm install -g create-react-app`

`create-react-app client`

We need to run this command:

`npx create-react-app client`

Important Reminder:

Once you have generated the React app you will need to delete the local git repository that Create React App may have automatically initialized.

Inside the newly created client directory, `run rm -r .git`

If you miss this step, the client folder will be considered a submodule and pushed as an empty folder to GitHub.

Documentation:

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npx

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.
