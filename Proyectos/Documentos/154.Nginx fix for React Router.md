# Nginx fix for React Router

In the next lecture, we will be adding some Nginx config to the client-side project, but I neglected to add one line that would get the Nginx server to work correctly when using React Router!

In the client/nginx/default.conf file, please add the following line to the end of the location directive:

    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;

The default.conf should now look like this:

    server {
      listen 3000;
     
      location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
      }
    }
